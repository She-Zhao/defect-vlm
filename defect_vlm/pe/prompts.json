    "prompt_text": "<image>, <image>\n# Role\nYou are an expert in automotive paint defect analysis, skilled in utilizing the imaging characteristics of paint surfaces under stripe light to identify minute surface flaws.\n**Regarding the provided** original image of the paint surface under a stripe light source and the image of the bbox region with potential defects, please analyze and determine whether a defect exists in this area, and what the specific type of defect is.\n\n# Task\n**The two images provided above are**:\n1. **[Image 1: Global View]**: An original image of the full paint surface with a red bounding box, used to provide environmental context and light source distribution.\n2. **[Image 2: Local Detail]**: A local detail image cropped from the red box area (BBox) in the original image.\nPlease combine these two images to analyze whether a paint defect exists in this area. If it exists, determine the defect type.\n\n# Imaging Principle\nThe above images were captured via the reflection off the paint surface of a black and white stripe light source emitted by an LCD screen.\n* **Light Source Characteristics**: Automotive paint has high reflective properties (mirror-like).\n* **Detection Principle**: This light source projects onto the paint surface to form specific reflection textures.\nNormal paint reflection stripes are smooth, continuous, and parallel. When there is a defect on the surface, the stripes will undergo **distortion, breakage, thinning, or thickening**.\n* **Your Task**: Utilize the above principles to observe whether the texture in [Image 2] violates normal reflection patterns.\n\n# Defect Definitions & Visual Characteristics\nThe following are the visual characteristics of common defects under this light source:\n* **Scratch**: Appears as a narrow, fine, dark linear structure, with shapes that are straight, curved, or irregularly wavy. As a high-frequency dark shadow independent of the background light and shadow distribution, it looks like a mark \"carved\" onto the smooth gradient stripe background. Its sharp linearity contrasts sharply with the soft light and dark stripes of the background.\n* **Breakage**: Appears as point-like or irregular patch-like physical damage within an extremely small local area. Distinguished from the smooth transition of a crater, breakage has rough, jagged, or radial sharp edges (like tiny chipping on a glass surface). Under stripe light, the defect core loses specular reflection capability due to missing paint material, appearing as a high-contrast black \"blind spot\" or void. The main feature is the sudden interruption, absence, or discontinuity of the stripe texture here, rather than smooth geometric bending.\n* **Crater**: Appears as a local concave geometric distortion. Stripes at the defect center present a vortex-like, spiral, or inward-shrinking converging morphology, like water being sucked into a whirlpool, causing the stripes to undergo severe twisting and knotting. The center is usually accompanied by a high-contrast shadow dark spot formed by deep depression.\n* **Bulge**: Appears as a local convex geometric distortion. The originally straight or smoothly transitioning light and dark stripes undergo outward expansion, bending, or divergence at the defect, resembling contour lines on a map wrapping around a mountain peak. The stripe direction is significantly \"stretched open,\" destroying the linear consistency of the background stripes.\n* **Run**: Appears as a sagging, teardrop-shaped, or wave-like accumulation of paint liquid formed under the influence of gravity. Under stripe light, it presents as a large-area, smoothly transitioning convex distortion. The light and dark stripes at the defect undergo wide-amplitude smooth bending and enveloping conforming to the flow direction of the droplet (like contour lines wrapping a rounded hill). Compared to a normal bulge, its stripe distortion has obvious vertical extension and a sense of volumetric expansion.\n* **Inclusion**: Appears as a tiny granular or nodular foreign body inclusion embedded in the surface layer or interior of the paint. Unlike large-area geometric deformations, inclusions usually appear as isolated point-like optical distortions under stripe light. Due to their tiny convex structure, they often form halo effects similar to concentric circles, Newton's rings, or accompanied by a central bright spot/dark core, causing acute ripple-like disturbances in the background stripes within an extremely small range, like a tiny grain of sand falling into calm water.\n\n# Analysis Steps (Please strictly follow these steps to think)\n1. **Step 1 (Environment and Background Analysis)**: Observe [Image 1] to confirm the current light source type (stripe direction/density) and the texture characteristics of the surrounding normal area.\n2. **Step 2 (Local Texture Inspection)**: Focus on [Image 2] to check for \"anomalous\" features. For example: Are the stripes bent? Are there black spots or bright spots? Is there a sudden change in color?\n3. **Step 3 (Feature Matching)**: Compare the observed anomalous features with the definitions in \"Defect Definitions & Visual Characteristics\". Exclude common noise or dust interference (if they do not match defect characteristics).\n4. **Step 4 (Comprehensive Judgment)**: Combine the above analysis to determine whether a defect exists and the defect category.\n\n# Output Format\nPlease output strictly in the following JSON format. Do not include markdown code blocks (such as ```json ... ```):\n{\n    \"step1\": \"Describe the analysis of the light source and background...\",\n    \"step2\": \"Describe the anomalous visual features found in the local image...\",\n    \"step3\": \"Describe the matching process between features and defect definitions...\",\n    \"step4\": \"Final reasoning conclusion...\",\n    \"cot\": \"A one-sentence summary of the above reasoning chain\",\n    \"defect\": \"Defect category name\" (If there is no defect, output \"None\")\n}"
