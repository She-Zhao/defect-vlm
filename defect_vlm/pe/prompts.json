    "prompt_text": "<image>, <image>\n# Role\nYou are an expert in automotive paint defect analysis, skilled in utilizing the imaging characteristics of paint surfaces under stripe light to identify minute surface flaws.\n**Regarding the provided** original image of the paint surface under a stripe light source and the image of the bbox region with potential defects, please analyze and determine whether a defect exists in this area, and what the specific type of defect is.\n\n# Task\n**The two images provided above are**:\n1. **[Image 1: Global View]**: An original image of the full paint surface with a red bounding box, used to provide environmental context and light source distribution.\n2. **[Image 2: Local Detail]**: A local detail image cropped from the red box area (BBox) in the original image.\nPlease combine these two images to analyze whether a paint defect exists in this area. If it exists, determine the defect type.\n\n# Imaging Principle\nThe above images were captured via the reflection off the paint surface of a black and white stripe light source emitted by an LCD screen.\n* **Light Source Characteristics**: Automotive paint has high reflective properties (mirror-like).\n* **Detection Principle**: This light source projects onto the paint surface to form specific reflection textures.\nNormal paint reflection stripes are smooth, continuous, and parallel. When there is a defect on the surface, the stripes will undergo **distortion, breakage, thinning, or thickening**.\n* **Your Task**: Utilize the above principles to observe whether the texture in [Image 2] violates normal reflection patterns.\n\n# Defect Definitions & Visual Characteristics\nThe following are the visual characteristics of common defects under this light source:\n* **Scratch**: Appears as a narrow, fine, dark linear structure, with shapes that are straight, curved, or irregularly wavy. As a high-frequency dark shadow independent of the background light and shadow distribution, it looks like a mark \"carved\" onto the smooth gradient stripe background. Its sharp linearity contrasts sharply with the soft light and dark stripes of the background.\n* **Breakage**: Appears as point-like or irregular patch-like physical damage within an extremely small local area. Distinguished from the smooth transition of a crater, breakage has rough, jagged, or radial sharp edges (like tiny chipping on a glass surface). Under stripe light, the defect core loses specular reflection capability due to missing paint material, appearing as a high-contrast black \"blind spot\" or void. The main feature is the sudden interruption, absence, or discontinuity of the stripe texture here, rather than smooth geometric bending.\n* **Crater**: Appears as a local concave geometric distortion. Stripes at the defect center present a vortex-like, spiral, or inward-shrinking converging morphology, like water being sucked into a whirlpool, causing the stripes to undergo severe twisting and knotting. The center is usually accompanied by a high-contrast shadow dark spot formed by deep depression.\n* **Bulge**: Appears as a local convex geometric distortion. The originally straight or smoothly transitioning light and dark stripes undergo outward expansion, bending, or divergence at the defect, resembling contour lines on a map wrapping around a mountain peak. The stripe direction is significantly \"stretched open,\" destroying the linear consistency of the background stripes.\n* **Run**: Appears as a sagging, teardrop-shaped, or wave-like accumulation of paint liquid formed under the influence of gravity. Under stripe light, it presents as a large-area, smoothly transitioning convex distortion. The light and dark stripes at the defect undergo wide-amplitude smooth bending and enveloping conforming to the flow direction of the droplet (like contour lines wrapping a rounded hill). Compared to a normal bulge, its stripe distortion has obvious vertical extension and a sense of volumetric expansion.\n* **Inclusion**: Appears as a tiny granular or nodular foreign body inclusion embedded in the surface layer or interior of the paint. Unlike large-area geometric deformations, inclusions usually appear as isolated point-like optical distortions under stripe light. Due to their tiny convex structure, they often form halo effects similar to concentric circles, Newton's rings, or accompanied by a central bright spot/dark core, causing acute ripple-like disturbances in the background stripes within an extremely small range, like a tiny grain of sand falling into calm water.\n\n# Analysis Steps (Please strictly follow these steps to think)\n1. **Step 1 (Environment and Background Analysis)**: Observe [Image 1] to confirm the current light source type (stripe direction/density) and the texture characteristics of the surrounding normal area.\n2. **Step 2 (Local Texture Inspection)**: Focus on [Image 2] to check for \"anomalous\" features. For example: Are the stripes bent? Are there black spots or bright spots? Is there a sudden change in color?\n3. **Step 3 (Feature Matching)**: Compare the observed anomalous features with the definitions in \"Defect Definitions & Visual Characteristics\". Exclude common noise or dust interference (if they do not match defect characteristics).\n4. **Step 4 (Comprehensive Judgment)**: Combine the above analysis to determine whether a defect exists and the defect category.\n\n# Output Format\nPlease output strictly in the following JSON format. Do not include markdown code blocks (such as ```json ... ```):\n{\n    \"step1\": \"Describe the analysis of the light source and background...\",\n    \"step2\": \"Describe the anomalous visual features found in the local image...\",\n    \"step3\": \"Describe the matching process between features and defect definitions...\",\n    \"step4\": \"Final reasoning conclusion...\",\n    \"cot\": \"A one-sentence summary of the above reasoning chain\",\n    \"defect\": \"Defect category name\" (If there is no defect, output \"None\")\n}"

    "prompt_text": "<image>\n<image>\nPrior Hint: {}\n\n# Role & Imaging Principle\nYou are an automotive paint defect analysis expert, excelling at judging whether defects exist in specific areas of automotive paint based on reflection characteristics under striped light.\nSince automotive paint is a mirror-like high-reflective surface, the system uses an LCD screen to project black and white striped light sources, forming reflection textures on the paint surface which are captured by an industrial camera. You need to make judgments based on the texture distortion in the captured images.\n\n# Image Input Description\nTwo images are provided above:\n1. **[Image 1: Global View]**: A global view mosaic showing the macroscopic state of the paint surface, where a **red box** marks the area to be verified this time.\n2. **[Image 2: Local Detail]**: A local detail mosaic, corresponding to the magnified view of the red box area, presented in pseudo-RGB colors (only used to enhance contrast).\nEach image is a **2×2 grid** stitched from four sub-images. The four patches (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right) represent the imaging of the **same physical location under 4 different types of striped light sources**.\n\n# Task Objectives & Notes\nFor the red box area, the prior defect hint is: **\"{}\"**. **Please note: This hint may be inaccurate, and the area may even be completely defect-free.**\n\nYour task is to utilize the visual information from [Image 1] and [Image 2] to **verify whether a defect matching the prior hint truly exists in the red box area**. If it does not match, please correct it to the real defect category; if there is no defect, please output \"None\".\n\n# Notes\n- **Single Target Focus**: Focus only on the red box area and its corresponding details in [Image 2]. Even if other defects exist in the global view or within the red box, please **ignore** them and only verify/correct the current prior type.\n- **Single Light Source Judgment**: Defects may be clearly visible only in a specific patch. **As long as clear defect features are found in any one patch, the area is judged to have a defect.**\n- **Texture Priority**: Ignore the pseudo-RGB colors and focus on **texture geometric morphology** (distortion, breakage) and **light-dark contrast**.\n\n# Defect Definitions & Imaging Characteristics\nThe following are the visual characteristics of common defects under this light source:\n* **Scratch**: Appears as a narrow, subtle dark linear structure, with shapes being straight, curved, or irregular waves. A scratch stands out as a high-frequency dark shadow independent of the background light and shadow distribution, like a mark \"carved\" on a smoothly graduating striped background. Its sharp lines contrast distinctly with the soft light and dark stripes of the background.\n* **Breakage**: Appears as a point-like or irregular patch-like physical damage within a very small local range. Distinguishable from the smooth transition of a crater, breakage has rough, jagged, or radial sharp edges. Under striped light, the defect core loses mirror reflection capability due to the lack of paint material, appearing as a high-contrast black \"blind spot\" or hole. The main feature is the abrupt interruption, absence, or discontinuity of the stripe texture here.\n* **Crater**: Appears as a concave geometric distortion in a local area. The stripes at the defect center present a vortex-like, spiral, or inward-contracting converging form, like water being sucked into a whirlpool, causing the stripes to twist and knot violently. The center is usually accompanied by a high-contrast dark shadow spot caused by deep depression.\n* **Bulge**: Appears as a convex geometric distortion in a local area. The originally straight or smoothly transitioning light and dark stripes expand, bend, or diverge outward at the defect, like contour lines on a map wrapping around a peak. The stripe direction is significantly \"stretched open,\" destroying the linear consistency of the background stripes.\n* **Run**: Appears as a drooping, teardrop-shaped, or wavy paint accumulation area caused by gravity. Under striped light, it presents as a large-area, smoothly transitioning convex distortion. The light and dark stripes at the defect undergo wide-range smooth bending and enveloping conforming to the flow direction of the droplet (like contour lines wrapping around a round hill). Compared to a normal bulge, its stripe distortion has obvious vertical extension and a sense of volumetric expansion.\n* **Inclusion**: Appears as a tiny granular or nodular foreign object inclusion embedded in the surface or interior of the paint layer. Unlike large-area geometric deformations, inclusions usually appear as isolated point-like optical distortions under striped light. Due to their tiny convex structure, they often form halo effects similar to concentric circles, Newton's rings, or accompanying central bright spots/dark cores, causing sharp ripple-like disturbances in the background stripes within a minimal range, like tiny gravel falling onto a calm water surface.\n\n# Analysis Steps (Please think strictly according to the following steps)\n1.  **Step 1 (Environment & Background Analysis)**: Observe [Image 1] and its four patches to confirm the normal flow of the stripes. Note the differences in background texture under different light sources.\n2.  **Step 2 (Local Texture Check)**: Focus on [Image 2] and its four patches. **Check each patch in turn**. Look for \"abnormal\" signals (such as stripe distortion, black spots, abnormal bright spots). Finding clear defect features in just one patch is enough to support the existence of a defect.\n3.  **Step 3 (Feature Matching & Comprehensive Analysis)**: Compare the observed abnormal features with the \"Defect Definitions\" to exclude common noise or dust interference. Output the reasoning process and analysis results in a Chain of Thought format.\n\n# Output Format\nPlease output strictly in the following JSON format, do not include markdown code blocks (such as ```json ... ```):\n{\n    \"step1\": \"Analyze the distribution of the four light sources and the background texture in the global view...\",\n    \"step2\": \"Describe the abnormal features found in any patch of the local view (e.g., obvious stripe breakage visible in the top-right patch)...\",\n    \"step3\": \"The reasoning process of matching features with defect definitions, output in Chain of Thought format...\",\n    \"defect\": \"Defect Category Name\" (If there is no defect, please output \"None\")\n}"
