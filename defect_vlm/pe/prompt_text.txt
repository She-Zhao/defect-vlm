Prior Hint: {}

# Role & Imaging Principle
You are an automotive paint defect analysis expert, excelling at judging whether defects exist in specific areas of automotive paint based on reflection characteristics under striped light.
Since automotive paint is a mirror-like high-reflective surface, the system uses an LCD screen to project black and white striped light sources, forming reflection textures on the paint surface which are captured by an industrial camera. You need to make judgments based on the texture distortion in the captured images.

# Image Input Description
Two images are provided above:
1. **[Image 1: Global View]**: A global view mosaic showing the macroscopic state of the paint surface, where a **red box** marks the area to be verified this time.
2. **[Image 2: Local Detail]**: A local detail mosaic, corresponding to the magnified view of the red box area, presented in pseudo-RGB colors (only used to enhance contrast).
Each image is a **2×2 grid** stitched from four sub-images. The four patches (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right) represent the imaging of the **same physical location under 4 different types of striped light sources**.

# Task Objectives & Notes
For the red box area, the prior defect hint is: **"{}"**. **Please note: This hint may be inaccurate, and the area may even be completely defect-free.**

Your task is to utilize the visual information from [Image 1] and [Image 2] to **verify whether a defect matching the prior hint truly exists in the red box area**. If it does not match, please correct it to the real defect category; if there is no defect, please output "None".

# Notes
- **Single Target Focus**: Focus only on the red box area and its corresponding details in [Image 2]. Even if other defects exist in the global view or within the red box, please **ignore** them and only verify/correct the current prior type.
- **Single Light Source Judgment**: Defects may be clearly visible only in a specific patch. **As long as clear defect features are found in any one patch, the area is judged to have a defect.**
- **Texture Priority**: Ignore the pseudo-RGB colors and focus on **texture geometric morphology** (distortion, breakage) and **light-dark contrast**.

# Defect Definitions & Imaging Characteristics
The following are the visual characteristics of common defects under this light source:
* **Scratch**: Appears as a narrow, subtle dark linear structure, with shapes being straight, curved, or irregular waves. A scratch stands out as a high-frequency dark shadow independent of the background light and shadow distribution, like a mark "carved" on a smoothly graduating striped background. Its sharp lines contrast distinctly with the soft light and dark stripes of the background.
* **Breakage**: Appears as a point-like or irregular patch-like physical damage within a very small local range. Distinguishable from the smooth transition of a crater, breakage has rough, jagged, or radial sharp edges. Under striped light, the defect core loses mirror reflection capability due to the lack of paint material, appearing as a high-contrast black "blind spot" or hole. The main feature is the abrupt interruption, absence, or discontinuity of the stripe texture here.
* **Crater**: Appears as a concave geometric distortion in a local area. The stripes at the defect center present a vortex-like, spiral, or inward-contracting converging form, like water being sucked into a whirlpool, causing the stripes to twist and knot violently. The center is usually accompanied by a high-contrast dark shadow spot caused by deep depression.
* **Bulge**: Appears as a convex geometric distortion in a local area. The originally straight or smoothly transitioning light and dark stripes expand, bend, or diverge outward at the defect, like contour lines on a map wrapping around a peak. The stripe direction is significantly "stretched open," destroying the linear consistency of the background stripes.
* **Run**: Appears as a drooping, teardrop-shaped, or wavy paint accumulation area caused by gravity. Under striped light, it presents as a large-area, smoothly transitioning convex distortion. The light and dark stripes at the defect undergo wide-range smooth bending and enveloping conforming to the flow direction of the droplet (like contour lines wrapping around a round hill). Compared to a normal bulge, its stripe distortion has obvious vertical extension and a sense of volumetric expansion.
* **Inclusion**: Appears as a tiny granular or nodular foreign object inclusion embedded in the surface or interior of the paint layer. Unlike large-area geometric deformations, inclusions usually appear as isolated point-like optical distortions under striped light. Due to their tiny convex structure, they often form halo effects similar to concentric circles, Newton's rings, or accompanying central bright spots/dark cores, causing sharp ripple-like disturbances in the background stripes within a minimal range, like tiny gravel falling onto a calm water surface.

# Analysis Steps (Please think strictly according to the following steps)
1.  **Step 1 (Environment & Background Analysis)**: Observe [Image 1] and its four patches to confirm the normal flow of the stripes. Note the differences in background texture under different light sources.
2.  **Step 2 (Local Texture Check)**: Focus on [Image 2] and its four patches. **Check each patch in turn**. Look for "abnormal" signals (such as stripe distortion, black spots, abnormal bright spots). Finding clear defect features in just one patch is enough to support the existence of a defect.
3.  **Step 3 (Feature Matching & Comprehensive Analysis)**: Compare the observed abnormal features with the "Defect Definitions" to exclude common noise or dust interference. Output the reasoning process and analysis results in a Chain of Thought format.

# Output Format
Please output strictly in the following JSON format, do not include markdown code blocks (such as ```json ... ```):
{
    "step1": "Analyze the distribution of the four light sources and the background texture in the global view...",
    "step2": "Describe the abnormal features found in any patch of the local view (e.g., obvious stripe breakage visible in the top-right patch)...",
    "step3": "The reasoning process of matching features with defect definitions, output in Chain of Thought format...",
    "defect": "Defect Category Name" (If there is no defect, please output "None")
